# Roadmap

Forward-looking, still-open items only — no diary of what's already
shipped. See [`../README.md`](../README.md) for the rule this file exists
to enforce (a completed item is deleted here the same PR that ships it,
not checked off and kept); `git log` and the `adr`/`investigations`
folders are where "what happened and why" actually lives.

- **Retention policies + cold storage to S3-compatible object storage
  (RustFS).** A separate item from multi-node scaling (which shipped —
  see [`../adr/0003-distributed-tables-plain-names-and-sharding.md`](../adr/0003-distributed-tables-plain-names-and-sharding.md)
  and [`../../docs/explanation/clustering.md`](../../docs/explanation/clustering.md)):
  this one is retention/cold storage, not horizontal availability/
  throughput. Not started. Prior-art design worth reusing, from SigNoz's
  TTL/cold-storage implementation ([signoz#1173](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/commit/5d080f5564c7839d0908db48bc8fff47d0e55648)):
  cold storage isn't app-level archival, it's ClickHouse's own tiered
  storage — an S3-backed disk/volume defined in ClickHouse's own config,
  with `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY TTL ... DELETE, ... TO VOLUME 'x'` moving
  aged parts onto it, so a table's storage policy just needs assigning
  once (idempotent) rather than anything bespoke on Flare's side; a
  `GetDisks`-style read of `system.disks` lets the retention UI offer a
  dropdown of volumes actually configured instead of free text. Because
  that `MODIFY TTL` is a long-running ClickHouse mutation, the set-TTL
  API should be async and status-tracked (a small table keyed by a
  transaction id, `pending`/`success`/`failed`, one row per underlying
  table) rather than blocking the request — reject a second set-TTL call
  while one's still `pending` instead of queuing another mutation, and
  have the GET endpoint return both the *actual* TTL (parsed live from
  ClickHouse) and the *expected* one (what was last requested) plus
  status, so the UI can show "applying…" instead of a stale value. One
  more ClickHouse config gotcha to get right when this is built: set
  `perform_ttl_move_on_insert: 0` on the S3 volume in ClickHouse's
  storage config - without it, ClickHouse evaluates the TTL-move rule
  synchronously on every insert once cold storage is configured, adding
  latency to the ingest path; the flag defers it to ClickHouse's
  background merge process instead
  ([signoz#1448](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/commit/f8f903848e914d529617c6e10c69b3644f8d4c30)).
- **Research: a real "skip-index effectiveness" signal for the Indexing
  page.** Deliberately not shipped — ClickHouse doesn't expose this as
  reliable production telemetry today. Full findings, including upstream
  ClickHouse's own attempt at exactly this (merged then reverted for a
  correctness bug) and what to check before revisiting:
  [`../investigations/skip-index-effectiveness-signal.md`](../investigations/skip-index-effectiveness-signal.md).
  Until upstream lands something reliable, the fallback is a
  differently-labeled, genuinely-computable proxy (e.g. "% of queries
  reading under N% of their table's total rows" from `system.query_log`) —
  real, just not skip-index-specific, since primary-key pruning contributes
  too.
- **Research: does the Logs free-text search actually use `idx_body`?**
  `LogFilterSqlBuilder` compiles `Search` to `Body ILIKE '%…%'`, but
  `idx_body` (`db/clickhouse/0001_logs.sql`) is a `tokenbf_v1` index, and
  ClickHouse's bloom-filter skip indexes aren't documented as usable for
  `ILIKE` - so every search may be full-scanning `Body` within the time
  window, and pattern (e) in
  [`../investigations/benchmark-ingest-and-query.md`](../investigations/benchmark-ingest-and-query.md)
  may be measuring a scan, not the index. First step: `EXPLAIN indexes = 1`
  on a real search against a live ClickHouse. If confirmed, likely fix is
  an additive `ngrambf_v1` index on `lower(Body)` with the search rewritten
  as `lower(Body) LIKE lower(…)` (new migration + probably an ADR). Prior
  art: [signoz#4787](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/commit/1585065fff9b7853d63e64abebf2887ecc42cc72).
- **Data-sources guides for more message brokers.** The Messaging page
  (ADR-0056) already picks up any broker whose .NET client emits OTel
  `messaging.*` spans, but the Data sources page only has Kafka and
  RabbitMQ guides. Candidates: MassTransit (built-in `MassTransit`
  activity source, `messaging.system` = the transport), and Azure Service
  Bus (Azure SDK activity sources, probably behind the SDK's experimental
  tracing switch; check). Verify each against a real broker before writing
  its guide (MassTransit over RabbitMQ, the Service Bus emulator image).
  Kafka's live run caught a receive+process double count that synthetic
  spans didn't. Not started.
- **Backlog for more brokers on the Messaging page.** Kafka (consumer lag)
  and RabbitMQ (queue depth, ADR-0057) fill the `Backlog` column. Next:
  Service Bus active/dead-letter counts via the collector's Azure Monitor
  receiver, Amazon SQS (`OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AWS` spans +
  CloudWatch depth), and NATS (NATS.Net v2 activity source). Each is one
  more metric lookup next to `MessagingQueryBuilder.BuildQueueDepth`. Not
  started.
- **Create/invite additional local users.** With local auth,
  `/api/auth/bootstrap` creates only the first admin, and
  `UserEndpoints` can list users, change a role and disable a user, but not
  create one - there's no API or dashboard path to a second local account
  (live e2e runs have had to write users into SQLite directly). Needed: an
  admin-only "invite user" (email/username + role → one-time
  set-password link, expiring) plus a dashboard form on the users page;
  bulk invite is a nice-to-have. Not started. Prior art:
  [signoz#6057](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/commit/fc4b55cb34b48fd3f47719be6ad6008b42d7e77d).
- **OpenAPI.NET v3 (`Microsoft.OpenApi` 3.x, OpenAPI spec 3.2).** Blocked on
  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`: 10.0.x caps it at `[2.12.0, 3.0.0)`, so the
  direct pin in `Directory.Packages.props` stays on 2.x. The first release
  that allows 3.x is 11.0 (RC1 requires `[3.10.0, 4.0.0)`), which needs the
  `net11.0` upgrade, so do both together; no 10.0.x servicing release has lifted the cap.
